    <p class="disclaimer">
        Apache Guacamole is an effort undergoing Incubation at The Apache
        Software Foundation (ASF), sponsored by the Incubator. Incubation is
        required of all newly accepted projects until a further review
        indicates that the infrastructure, communications, and decision making
        process have stabilized in a manner consistent with other successful
        ASF projects. While incubation status is not necessarily a reflection
        of the completeness or stability of the code, it does indicate that the
        project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.
